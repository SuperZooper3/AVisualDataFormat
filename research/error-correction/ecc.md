# Research - Error Correction Codes

The goal of this research project is to look at differnt types of error correctio, how they're useful, and easy of implementation.

The project will include written research notes as well as code.

## Goals

- Index of error correction codes, their properties, and their use cases
- Implementation of a few error correction codes
- Comparison of error correction codes and rankings of their usefulness for our vidual data format projects
  - Notable when it comes to what types of error correction make sense in 2D barcodes (also has to do with coloured codes, in the way that a colour being off can be more than 1 bit incorrect)
